# Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

We, as contributors and maintainers, pledge to foster an open and welcoming environment in our project and community. 
We are committed to ensuring that participation is a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, 
body size, disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender identity and expression, level of experience, education, 
socio-economic status, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

## Our Standards

We strive to create a positive environment through behaviors such as:

* Using inclusive and welcoming language
* Respecting differing viewpoints and experiences
* Accepting constructive criticism graciously
* Prioritizing the community's best interests
* Showing empathy towards fellow community members

Unacceptable behaviors include:

* Using sexualized language or imagery, and unwelcome sexual advances
* Trolling, derogatory comments, or personal/political attacks
* Harassment, whether public or private
* Sharing others' private information without explicit permission
* Any conduct that could be considered inappropriate in a professional context

## Our Responsibilities

Project maintainers are responsible for defining acceptable behavior standards and are expected to take fair and 
appropriate action in response to any instances of unacceptable behavior.

Maintainers have the authority to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and 
contributions that do not align with this Code of Conduct. They can also temporarily or permanently ban contributors 
for behaviors deemed inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies within project spaces and public spaces when individuals represent the project or 
community. Representation includes using an official project email address, posting on official social media accounts,
or acting as appointed representatives at events. The definition of representation may be further clarified by 
project maintainers.

## Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported by contacting the project 
team at santhoshse7en@gmail.com. All complaints will be reviewed and investigated, resulting in an appropriate 
response to the circumstances. The project team will maintain confidentiality regarding the identity of the reporter. 
Specific enforcement policies may be outlined separately.

Project maintainers who fail to follow or enforce the Code of Conduct in good faith may face temporary or permanent 
consequences as determined by other members of the project's leadership.
